We chose this topic because first of all we are interested in this topic ourselves and we were also interested in implementing this project, in the process of work we realized that our project may well have a good future. The idea is that by the name of the car we can search for them in movies, TV shows and then get information about them. There are plans for the future to add not only cars but also motorcycles, etc. 

Example:

The car is the same actor as others, movies also bring them fame. For example, the Camaro is not a premium car, but due to the appearance and competent marketing through the film, it becomes popular, our task is to facilitate this path. 

There are no similar search services in our country, since our project was created to promote car culture to the masses and a clear example of where and in what scenes cars were filmed. In its own way, this is a unique project and there are no analogues yet. Our project is a kind of wikipedia for fans of cars and movies. However, there are not exactly similar but essentially similar projects whatismymovie.com but there is a completely different technology involved. 

 

 

The audience of our project is motorists who want to see where and in what scenes this or that car took part, which is probably not so useful from the practical side, but it helps to promote auto culture through the media sphere. In addition, our site will also be of interest to moviegoers who want to learn more about which cars were used in their favorite movies. They will be able to read movie reviews and find out which machines were used in key scenes. This will help them better understand the film and its context. Our project will also be useful for automotive journalists and bloggers who can use our database to create their own materials. They can learn about new cars that appear in movies and write reviews based on this information. In general, our project will help promote auto and film culture through the media sphere. We hope that our website will become a popular and useful resource for everyone who is interested in cars and movies. 

Our project offers the following features for consumers:  

By entering the name of a car, users can find all the movies in which that car appeared. They can then access more extensive information about the car itself or the specific movie in which it appeared. Another feature allows users to suggest adding a particular movie that featured a certain car, even if there is no existing information about it. However, such requests need to be approved by a manager. The admin panel includes CRUD operations for movies, cars, and collections, providing the ability to create, read, update, and delete entries. Additionally, there are functions for searching for links to car photos and for viewing movies. 

In conclusion, our project is a valuable resource for car and movie enthusiasts alike. With our extensive database, users can easily find information about the cars used in their favorite movies or discover new movies featuring their favorite cars. Our website also offers a platform for automotive journalists and bloggers to create their own content based on our database. As we continue to expand our database to include other vehicles, we hope to further promote auto and film culture through the media sphere. We invite everyone who is interested in cars and movies to explore our website and discover something new.
